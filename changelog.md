### 2.0-beta1

### 1.4.0

 * Upgraded from Xcode8.2.1 to Xcode8.3.1
 * Classes derived from FormViewController can now be used inside storyboards. Added 'SettingsViewController' that demonstrates this.
   FormViewController.init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) have until now invoked super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil) so it has never worked inside a storyboard.
   FormViewController now instead implements init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) so it can invoke super.init(coder: aDecoder).
 * FormViewController.reloadForm() added.

### 1.3.0

 * iPad: cells now adheres to `cellLayoutMarginsFollowReadableWidth = true` and uses the layoutMargin left/right for computing the frames.
 * DatePickerFormItem.minuteInterval added.

### 1.2.0

 * Simplified specification pattern. In the future the `CompositeSpecification` class will be removed. Instead of subclassing `CompositeSpecification` one must instead subclass `Specification`.
 * Simplified the `CharacterSetSpecification` factory functions. In the future the `CharacterSetSpecification` the oldschool factory functions will be removed.
 * Fixed crash in the `Sign Up` example code. Tapping the "Export to JSON" button always crashed. The problem was introduced in the `DumpVisitor` class when the project got migrated from Xcode7 to Xcode8.
 * Wrote documentation for the files in `Source/Util` and `Source/Specification`. 
 * Upgraded from Xcode 8.0 to Xcode 8.1
 * Fixed crash: When using a custom view for the section header and providing a height less than 10 pixels could cause expand/collapse to crash.  
 * Longer section header titles affects expand/collapse animations. Here it's better to use a custom view as section header.
